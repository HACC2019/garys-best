Questions for Jimmy

Questions 10/26/19:
1. I was taking a look at the Data_HACC file and noticed that there was data for 2 of the charging stations. If I recall correctly, you mentioned that there are 19 charging stations managed by Hawaiian Electric. Will the data for these stations be provided as well?

Questions 11/2/19:
1. Would it be useful to label "rounding errors" and "non-rounding errors" pertaining to the calculated cost per session as separate categories? For example, in one case we have the listed amount as $3.80 but per the energy and the rate at the given start time, we found the correctly rounded number to actually be $3.81. However in other cases the listed amount is $0.00 but the actual total is something like $31.90. On a final dashboard would it be useful to separate the two? 
2. Is it safe to assume that the calculated amount using energy and the given start time is always correct?
3. Would it be more useful for you folks to have a database with a table that is self correcting and a separate table that records the error history or should we not worry about self correction and only focus on error reporting (mainly in the case that the answer to question 2 is no)
